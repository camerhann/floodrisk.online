# 05: Content Management & SEO Strategy for floodrisk.online

This document details the strategy for ongoing content management, particularly for the blog, and foundational Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices.

## 1. Content Management Workflow (Blog)

This workflow focuses on ease of use with Cursor and Markdown, leveraging AI assistance.

1.  **Content Ideas & Planning (Chris & AI):**
    *   Brainstorm blog post topics relevant to target audiences (Environmental Consultants, Civil Engineers, Architects, Planners, Homeowners).
    *   Focus on pain points, solutions, industry updates (NPPF, NAFRA2), case studies (anonymized if necessary), and thought leadership.
    *   Use AI in Cursor to help generate ideas or outlines.
2.  **Drafting with AI Assistance (Cursor):**
    *   Chris uses Cursor's chat/edit features to generate initial drafts based on outlines or specific prompts (e.g., "Draft a blog post about the key challenges in SuDS design for urban areas, aimed at civil engineers").
3.  **Refinement & Expert Input (Chris):**
    *   Chris reviews and heavily edits AI-generated drafts to ensure technical accuracy, inject personal experience, insights, and maintain his unique voice. This step is crucial for high-quality, authoritative content.
4.  **Markdown Formatting:**
    *   Format the post using Markdown syntax within Cursor.
    *   **Frontmatter:** Include at the top of each `.md` file:
        *   `title: "Your Compelling Blog Post Title"`
        *   `date: "YYYY-MM-DD"`
        *   `author: "Chris Cameron-Hann"`
        *   `slug: "your-url-friendly-slug"` (e.g., `key-challenges-suds-design-urban`)
        *   `tags: ["Flood Risk", "SuDS", "Civil Engineering", "Urban Design"]` (or relevant tags)
        *   `excerpt: "A brief 1-2 sentence summary of the post for listings and meta descriptions."`
        *   `(Optional) featuredImage: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"`
5.  **Image Handling (If any):**
    *   Optimize images for web (compress, resize).
    *   Store in `public/images/blog/` directory.
    *   Reference using Markdown image syntax: `![Alt text for image](/images/blog/your-image.jpg)`
6.  **Local Preview (Next.js Dev Server):**
    *   Run `npm run dev` locally to preview the new blog post and ensure formatting is correct.
7.  **Commit & Push (Cursor/Git):**
    *   Add the new Markdown file (and any images) to Git.
    *   Commit with a clear message (e.g., "feat: add new blog post on SuDS challenges").
    *   Push to the Git repository.
8.  **Automatic Deployment:**
    *   Vercel/Netlify will automatically pick up the changes, rebuild the site, and deploy the new blog post.

## 2. SEO Strategy (Foundational)

This focuses on on-page and technical SEO best practices suitable for a Next.js site.

1.  **Keyword Research (Initial & Ongoing):**
    *   Identify primary and secondary keywords for each page and blog post (e.g., "flood risk assessment UK," "SuDS design guidance," "NPPF sequential test").
    *   AI tools can assist in identifying relevant keywords.
2.  **On-Page SEO:**
    *   **Titles:** Use keywords naturally in page titles (`<title>` tag, often derived from frontmatter `title` in Next.js).
    *   **Meta Descriptions:** Craft unique, compelling meta descriptions (150-160 characters) for each page and blog post (can use `excerpt` from frontmatter or generate with AI, then refine).
        *   Next.js `Head` component or `generateMetadata` function can be used for this.
    *   **Headings (H1, H2, H3):** Use headings logically to structure content. The main title of a page/post should typically be an H1. Use keywords where appropriate.
    *   **Content Quality:** Well-written, informative, and original content is paramount. Chris's expertise is the core asset here.
    *   **Internal Linking:** Link relevantly between your blog posts and service pages. E.g., a blog post on SuDS should link to the "Consultancy as a Service" page if appropriate.
    *   **Image Alt Text:** Provide descriptive alt text for all images for accessibility and SEO.
3.  **Technical SEO (Leveraging Next.js & Hosting Platform):**
    *   **Sitemap:** Generate an XML sitemap (e.g., using a Next.js API route like `pages/sitemap.xml.js` or a build-time script) and submit it to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
    *   **Robots.txt:** Create a `public/robots.txt` file to guide web crawlers (e.g., allow all, or disallow specific paths if necessary).
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensured by using Tailwind CSS and testing (already in plan).
    *   **Page Speed:** Next.js with SSG/ISR and hosting on Vercel/Netlify generally results in excellent performance. Optimize images.
    *   **HTTPS:** Provided automatically by Vercel/Netlify.
    *   **Structured Data (Schema Markup - Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Add JSON-LD schema markup for articles, services, and potentially `Person` (for Chris) or `Organization` (for Aegaea/floodrisk.online).
        *   This can enhance search engine understanding and rich snippet potential.
        *   AI can help generate JSON-LD templates.
4.  **URL Structure:**
    *   Use clean, descriptive URLs (handled by Next.js file-based routing and frontmatter slugs for blog posts).
5.  **Analytics & Monitoring:**
    *   **Set up Google Search Console:** Submit sitemap, monitor indexing status, check for crawl errors, view search queries.
    *   **Set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or a privacy-focused alternative (Plausible, Fathom):** Track website traffic, user behavior, and content performance.
    *   Regularly review analytics to understand what content resonates and identify opportunities.

## 3. Post-Launch Content Promotion (Initial Ideas)

*   **LinkedIn:** Share new blog posts and service announcements on Chris's LinkedIn profile, leveraging his existing network.
*   **Cross-Promotion:** Mention `floodrisk.online` and the new service on the Aegaea Ltd. website/communications if appropriate.
*   **(Optional) Email List:** If an email list is built (e.g., via a newsletter signup), announce new posts and offers there.
*   **(Optional) Guest Posting/Collaborations:** Explore opportunities in the future to write for other relevant industry sites, linking back to `floodrisk.online`.

This integrated content and SEO strategy, powered by AI assistance and streamlined through Cursor and modern web technologies, will help `floodrisk.online` attract, engage, and convert its target audience.
